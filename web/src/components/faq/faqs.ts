      q: "How can I add funds?",
      a: "Simply pick the party for the NFT collection you want and tap Add Funds and select the amount of ETH you'd like to contribute. The party will combine all funds to buy an NFT in the collection.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I withdraw my funds?",
      a: "Yes! You can withdraw your funds as long as there is no active bid (if there is an active bid out, you can wait for the bid to expire). Simply tap on Withdraw on the top right and pick the contribution you'd like to withdraw."
    },
    {
      q: "How does a party buy an NFT?",
      a: "Your Party actively monitors current NFT pricing and when there's enough fund to buy an NFT in the collection, the Party makes a bid to buy one (or if one is being offered, the party just buys one outright). Today this is done by knowledgable admins, but we're moving it to an automated system. After purchasing an NFT, your contribution in the Party is reduced proportionally to the purchase price.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does fractional ownership work?",
      a: "Your NFT is placed inside a fractional.art vault (which is a battle-tested contract), then a set number of shares is issued for the vault, and every contributor with ETH in the vault will receive shares proportianl to their contribution.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is fractional ownership better?",
      a: "Don't want to shell out 100 ETH for a Bored Ape or 75 ETH for a cryptopunk? Spend just 0.1 ETH and have fractional ownership. You can enjoy the upside and use it as your profile photo. ", 
    },
    {
      q: "Do I get associated privledges with the NFT?",
      a: "It depends. If the NFT collection drops items or tokens associated with your party-owned NFT, those drops will go into the vault and your shares will have fractional ownership of those. However, if events or access to certain functions require proof of ownership, your fractional shares would not work. (Because the NFT is technically owned by the vault)",
    },
    {
      q: "What are founder rewards?",
      a: "Only on successful buys, TopParty.xyz's admin address will receive 2.5% of both the ETH used in the purhcase and the resulting shares.",
    },
